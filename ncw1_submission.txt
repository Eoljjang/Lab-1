Question 2: Version 2.31.0 is installed on my machine.

Question 3: Version 2.31.0 is installed in the virtual environment. The same as my local machine.

Question 4: The virtual environment is like its own separate machine. Thus, its Python is "vanilla" and does not have the same packages
as the Python on my local machine may have (which is why we had to pip3 install requests again in the venv). For example, I have PyMongo
installed on my local machine, but on the venv it doesn't exist until I install it again.
